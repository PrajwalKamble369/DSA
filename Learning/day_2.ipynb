    "\n",
    "- Time complexity in computer science describe how the execution time of an algorithms grows as the input size increases. \n",
    "- It essentially quantifies the number of operations an algorithm performs as a function of the input data size. \n",
    "- It is kind of function which help us to find the execution time for an algorithm (program) with respect to the input size.\n",
    "- As the size of input increase how much execution time is increasing is time complexity. \n",
    "- If we find the number of operations in a program then we can find time complexity because time complexity is directly proportional to number of operations at being done at program.\n",
